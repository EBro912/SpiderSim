Have you ever felt like theres a lack of 8 legged bois in your server? if no, get out. if yes:
# Try SpiderSim
Which brings the dbl mod Spider to your smol bean server with simple chatting and server info stuff.
your sudden lack of spiders is over when spider sim starts a party (i forgot what else it did)
